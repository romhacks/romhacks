Hey there!

We're Scarlett, hobbyist programmers and general technology enthusiasts.
There's not much of anything good here right now, but we're working on several things that might be available soon ;)

We're currently learning Rust and Flutter.

If you'd like to contact us, please do so through Discord. My user is `scarlett#1891`. I promise we won't bite!

We are also reachable at `scarlett@electronika.xyz`.
