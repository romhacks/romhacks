Hey there!

I'm scarlett, and this is in fact my github profile.

I'm currently learning Flutter and Dart to hopefully contribute to future projects. Rust too. Not to contribute to anything, just because I feel like we need to learn Rust. You should feel that too.

If you'd like to contact us, please do so through Discord. My user is `scarlett#1891`. I promise we won't bite!

We are also reachable at `scarlett@electronika.xyz`.
